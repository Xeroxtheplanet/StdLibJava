	    say, there are n players that enter a tournament.
        assume n is a power of 2 (so 1, 2, 4, 8, 16...)
        the tournament has knock-out format.

        so if 8 players enter:

        round 1: p1 vs p2, p3 vs p4, p5 vs p6, p7 vs p8
        round 2 (as an example): p2 vs p3, p5 vs p8
        round 3 (as an example): p3 vs p8
        winner p3

        now, i keep the information in an array. 0 represents loss, 1 represents win

        the above scenario is represented in the following array.
        i have spaced it out based on rounds.

        {0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,       0,1,0,1,        1,0}

        Your job is that given a valid array, determine which player won (in this case: 3)

        Some more examples (pretty trivial, for 16 players this time):

        {1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,       1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,    1,0,1,0,    1,0}
        winner would be player 1

        {0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,      0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1    0,1,0,1,    0,1}
        winner would be player 16
	 * @param results 
	 * assume in valid format. that is, exactly one of results[2*i], results[2*i+1] for all i, is 1
	 * also assume that results.length = 2*n-2 where n represents number of players. You may assume that n is a power of 2.
	 * @return player number who won the tournament (return 1 for the first player, 2 for the second player, and so on)
	 * 
	 * CHALLENGE: Time complexity should be O(log n)
